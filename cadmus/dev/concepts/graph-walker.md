## Walker

The walker is used to traverse the graph by exploring the connections of an arbitrarily chosen starting node in it. Its UI provides an easy way of getting to the desired node, while also visualizing the connections of a specific node.

As the graph may quickly grow up in size, it would be impractical to represent all the nodes and their links (edges) at once; the graph would be barely readable, overcrowded by a high number of overlapping shapes and lines. The solution adopted in the editor, where users may want to explore the relations starting from an object towards any other object, is displaying nodes and edges as you walk across the graph. Also, all the edges of the same type are initially grouped under a single graphical element.

So, you start from a single node, and just see all its "outbound" (i.e. where this node is the subject) and "inbound" (i.e. where this node is the object) links, grouped by type, with their counts. For instance, if the node has 4 labels in 4 different languages, you won't see 4 links, but just a node representing their group. When you double click it, it will expand into those 4 links, each leading to another node. In the same way, you will be able to walk along all the links, from node to node, progressively unveiling the graph.

Additionally, a number of filters are available to be freely combined, so that you see only those links or nodes you are interested in. These filters vary according to the node selected while walking, and each node retains its own filtering state.

## API

Cadmus provides a graph-specific API to handle the graph, with a number of endpoints.

- [API code repository](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_api): [GraphController](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_api/blob/master/Cadmus.Api.Controllers/GraphController.cs)

### API - Nodes

- `GET api/graph/nodes`: get a page of graph nodes. Filters:
  - `pageNumber`
  - `pageSize`
  - `uid`: any portion of the node's UID to match.
  - `isClass`: match node's class status.
  - `tag`: null (match any), empty (match null tags), non-empty (match the specified tag).
  - `label`: any portion of the node's label to match.
  - `sourceType`: type of source (0-N).
  - `sid`: match node's SID.
  - `isSidPrefix`: match only the initial portion of the node's SID.
  - `classIds`: match only nodes inside any of the listed classes.
  - `linkedNodeId`: match only nodes directly linked to the specified node ID.
  - `linkedNodeRole`: the role of the node identified by linkedNodeId: `S`ubject or `O`bject.
- `GET api/graph/nodes/ID`: get the node with the specified ID.
- `GET api/graph/nodes-set`: get the nodes with the specified IDs.
- `GET api/graph/nodes-by-uri`: get nodes by URI.
- `POST api/graph/nodes`: add or update the specified node.
- `DELETE api/graph/nodes/ID`: delete the node with the specified ID.

### API - Triples

- `GET api/graph/triples`: get a page of graph triples. Filters:
  - `pageNumber`
  - `pageSize`
  - `subjectId`: the ID of the subject node.
  - `predicateIds`: the ID(s) the predicate node should belong to.
  - `notPredicateIds`: the ID(s) the predicate node should not belong to.
  - `hasLiteralObject`: true to match only triples with a literal object, false to match only triples with a non literal object, null to match any.
  - `objectId`: the ID of the object node.
  - `sid`: match triple's SID.
  - `isSidPrefix`: match only the initial portion of the triple's SID.
  - `tag`: null (match any), empty (match null tags), non-empty (match the specified tag).
  - `sort`: the sort order.
- `GET api/graph/triples/ID`: get the triple with the specified ID.
- `POST api/graph/triples`: add or update the specified node.
- `DELETE api/graph/triples/ID`: delete the triple with the specified ID.

### API - Walker

- `GET api/graph/walk/triples`: get walker triples. Filters:
  - `pageNumber`
  - `pageSize`
  - `subjectId`: the ID of the subject node.
  - `predicateIds`: the ID(s) the predicate node should belong to.
  - `notPredicateIds`: the ID(s) the predicate node should not belong to.
  - `hasLiteralObject`: true to match only triples with a literal object, false to match only triples with a non literal object, null to match any.
  - `objectId`: the ID of the object node.
  - `sid`: match triple's SID.
  - `isSidPrefix`: match only the initial portion of the triple's SID.
  - `tag`: null (match any), empty (match null tags), non-empty (match the specified tag).
  - `sort`: the sort order.
- `GET api/graph/walk/nodes`: get walker linked nodes. Filter:
  - `pageNumber`
  - `pageSize`
  - `uid`: match node's UID.
  - `isClass`: match node's class status.
  - `tag`: null (match any), empty (match null tags), non-empty (match the specified tag).
  - `label`: any portion of the node's label to match.
  - `sourceType`: type of source (0-N).
  - `sid`: match node's SID.
  - `isSidPrefix`: match only the initial portion of the node's SID.
  - `classIds`: match only nodes inside any of the listed classes.
  - `otherNodeId`: match the other node identifier, which is the subject node ID when `isObject` is true, otherwise the object node ID.
  - `predicateId`: the property identifier in the triple including the node to match, either as a subject or as an object (according to `isObject`).
  - `isObject`: whether the node to match is the object (true) or the subject (false) of the triple having predicate `predicateId`.
- `GET api/graph/walk/nodes/literal`: get walker linked literals. Filter:
  - `pageNumber`
  - `pageSize`
  - `literalPattern`: the regular expression to match the literal.
  - `literalType`: the type of the object literal. This corresponds to literal suffixes after `^^` in Turtle: e.g. `"12.3"^^xs:double`.
  - `literalLanguage`: literal's language to match.
  - `minLiteralNumber`: max numeric value for a numeric object literal.
  - `maxLiteralNumber`: min numeric value for a numeric object literal.
  - `subjectId`: the subject node ID in the triple including the literal to match.
  - `predicateId`: the predicate node ID in the triple including the literal to match.
