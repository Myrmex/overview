The typical steps for developing a Cadmus backend are:

1. [create the backend core data models](backend-core.md) (optional).
2. [create the backend services](backend-core-svc.md).
3. create the backend API.

Step 1 is required only if you are going to add new models (parts/fragments). If you are just reusing existing models, you can proceed directly to step 2.
