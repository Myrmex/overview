Here are some toys created for didactic purposes:

- [abacus](toys/abacus/abacus.html): a simple generator for an epigraphical abacus from Greek Egypt. This demonstrates the usage of a custom HTML 6 element.
- [daskalos](https://myrmex-daskalos.surge.sh/): this shows a tiny interactive quiz tool fed by a JSON document.
- [Liddell-Scott and Lewis-Short Online](https://lsj.fusi-soft.com): a minimalist browser for these Perseus TEI-based dictionaries, converted using [Proteus](proteus.md). An offline Windows desktop version is available in the [downloads](downloads.md) section.
- [mensor](https://myrmex-mensor.surge.sh/): ancient measurement units converter (Greek, Roman, Egyptian). This demonstrates a simple PWA app.
- [sigla](https://myrmex-sigla.surge.sh/): Roman and Greek epigraphical abbreviations, perpetual Roman calendar, ancient eras converter. This demonstrates a simple PWA app.
