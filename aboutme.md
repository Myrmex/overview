## About me

As a classical philologist and software developer, I have been working in Digital Humanities both in the academic and in the business field. After my degree in Classics at the University of Rome Sapienza, and my PhD in Greek and Latin philology at the University of Genoa, I have been teaching DH at the University of Rome Sapienza for a decade, while designing and implementing custom software solutions in my one-man company, especially for Universities, Academic institutions, and business publishing companies, mostly in the fields of digital editions, linguistics, metrics, philology, epigraphy, archives, and lexicography.

I am currently part of the [Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities](https://www.unive.it/pag/39287) (VeDPH), so you can reach me at `daniele.fusi` dot `unive.it`.

These pages are just a stub for some demonstrative content coming from my research in Digital Humanities, as I have very little time to update them. Most of this content was published to provide some documentation to team members or students. Some of the projects have their own sites, and you will find the links in their page.
