## About me

As a classical philologist and software developer, I have been working in Digital Humanities both in the academic and in the business field. After my degree in Classics at the University of Rome Sapienza, and my PhD in Greek and Latin philology at the University of Genoa, I have been teaching DH at the University of Rome Sapienza for a decade, while designing and implementing custom software solutions in my one-man company, especially for Universities, Academic institutions, and business publishing companies, mostly in the fields of digital editions, linguistics, metrics, philology, epigraphy, archives, and lexicography.

I am currently part of the [Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities](https://www.unive.it/pag/39287) (VeDPH), so you can reach me at `daniele.fusi` dot `unive.it`.
