Here I collect some miscellaneous tools still used by some friends and teammates:

- [LSJ Lite](lsj/lsjlite.md): [Liddell-Scott-Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Greek%E2%80%93English_Lexicon) Greek-English Lexicon, and [Lewis-Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Latin_Dictionary</a>) Latin-English Lexicon, in an offline reader. An online version can be found [here](lsj.fusi-soft.com).
- [Theuth demo](theuth/theuth.md): a writing system for polytonic Greek, whose purpose is showing how my generic [Proteus](proteus.md) text converter framework can be creatively used also in assisting during text composition.
- [Khronos](khronos/khronos.md): a minimally intrusive countdown timer used during time-constrained speeches.
